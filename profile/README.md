# About us
## Hi, everybody! We are Foodwise!  
In August 2022 together with our team Oleksandr Oblanov and Danyil Tkachenko we have started working on this startup!
**Foodwise** is a cut-priced food ordering service. The goal of our project is to connect users interested in saving their own budget with food establishments. Our service will help increase the profit of small and medium-sized businesses by selling products whose shelf life is coming to an end. Through our upcoming mobile application, the user will have the opportunity to purchase discounted food in advance and be sure that it will reach him.

# What we suggest
Mobile app that will connect consumers with small and medium-sized businesses that have unsold food with small expiration date.  
- Businesses will pay 10% fee from every transaction
- For usual users app will be absolutely free (It goes without saying that you need to pay for food)
